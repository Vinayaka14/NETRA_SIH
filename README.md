This project explores the evolution and advancements in risk analysis and measurement in the contemporary financial landscape. It underscores the transition of these concepts from being niche to becoming integral parts of portfolio management and trading strategies. The project highlights the practical challenges in risk assessment and analysis, such as the selection of suitable risk models and avoidance of portfolio optimization pitfalls. It also addresses complex issues like horizon mismatches and the significance of out-of-sample testing. The project aims to offer a comprehensive overview of recent developments in risk analysis and modelling, with a focus on their practical applications for portfolio managers and traders. It seeks to illustrate how these tools can provide critical insights into portfolio risk dynamics. TradeCraft presents a comprehensive framework for implementing profitable trading strategies using Zipline, a powerful backtesting library, and PyFolio, a performance analysis tool. This paper outlines the steps involved in developing and evaluating trading algorithms, emphasizing machine learning techniques for predictive modeling. By leveraging Zipline's capabilities for historical data analysis and portfolio management, coupled with PyFolio's robust performance metrics, traders can effectively design, backtest, and optimize strategies for real-world deployment.
